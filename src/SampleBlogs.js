      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming web development in ways we never imagined. 
      Developers now rely on AI tools to streamline workflows, optimize code, and predict user behavior. 

      **1. Smarter Code Generation**  
      AI-powered code assistants can suggest entire code blocks or debug issues instantly, saving hours of work.

      **2. Personalized User Experiences**  
      With AI, websites can adapt content dynamically based on user behavior, location, and preferences.
